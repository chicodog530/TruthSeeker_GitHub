## ✨ Features

- **Automated Age-Gate Bypass**: Uses Playwright to automatically handle "I am not a robot" and "18+" prompts on Justice.gov and similar sites.
- **Smart Range Scanning**: Finds files by scanning numeric patterns (e.g., `FILE001.mp4`, `FILE002.mp4`).
- **Real-Time Feed**: Results stream live to your browser using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Soft-404 Detection**: Automatically rejects "File Not Found" HTML pages that return a 200 OK status.
- **Media Validation**: Verifies file headers and sizes to ensure only real video files are saved.
- **Export Options**: Save your findings as high-quality PDF reports or portable HTML galleries.
- **Premium Dark UI**: A sleek, modern interface optimized for desktop use.
