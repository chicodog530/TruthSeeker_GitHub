# User Instructions: How to Use TruthSeeker

TruthSeeker is designed to be simple. You don't need to be a programmer to use it. Follow these steps to start finding files.

## 1. Getting Started

- **Open the folder** where you saved TruthSeeker.
- **Double-click** the file named `run_web.bat`.
- A black window (command prompt) will open. **Keep this window open** while you are using the app.
- Your web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) will open automatically to the TruthSeeker dashboard.

## 2. Setting Up a Search

### Step 1: The Seed URL
Find a file you already know exists on a website. For example:
`https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01648645.mp4`
Paste this URL into the **Seed URL** box at the top and click the **Parse** button.

### Step 2: Adjust Settings
- **Start #**: This will auto-fill with the number from your Seed URL. You can change this to a lower number if you want to search backwards, or a higher number to search forwards.
- **Max Scan**: How many files to check in one go.
- **Stop after misses**: If the app hits this many "empty" files in a row, it will stop automatically to save time.
- **Extensions**: Check `.mp4` or `.mov` depending on what you are looking for.

## 3. Handling Age Verification
If you are scanning a site like **Justice.gov**, TruthSeeker will handle the "I am not a robot" and "Age Verification" buttons for you:
1. When you click **Start Scan**, a new browser window may open.
2. The app will automatically click the buttons it needs.
3. Once the buttons are clicked, the window will close itself, and your scan will begin in the dashboard.

## 4. Saving Your Results
When the scan finishes:
- Click **Save HTML** to create a webpage with all your found links.
- Click **Save PDF** to create a professional report of your findings.

### 💡 Tips for Success
- **Internet Speed**: Scanning too fast might cause some sites to block you temporarily. If you see many errors, increase the **Min/Max Delay**.
- **Results Feed**: You can click the links in the results feed to watch the video immediately in a new tab.
